# Advent-of-Code
My solutions to the 2021 daily advent of code challenges hosted by www.adventofcode.com

# File Structure
- '/Resources' contains the instructions for each challenge. 
- '/data/raw' contains the personalized dataset I am working with. 
- '/src' contains the python code used to solve the challenge. 

# The Approach
All solutions are liberally commented with the logic used to solve the challenge.  
There are also commented '# LEARNING' sections that highlight something I learned as I coded the solution.  
In later challenges I include a '# TODO' for some aspect of my approach I feel could be improved.
